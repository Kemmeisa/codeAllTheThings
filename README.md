TO INSTALL THE WEB FOLLOW THE STEPS LISTED HERE:
http://elinux.org/RPi_webserver

For this test I used a root mysql database with password root99.

Once everything is setup/install properly mv the piweb folder to /var/www/html/
Make sure all your permissions are www-data:www-data and 755

You should be able to then go to localhost/piweb/ and see a chart render
